```ruby
puts 'Hello world!'
```

Hi :-)

This is _Yet Another Dev Blog_. I got already [one for GNOME and Distros' stuff](http://blogs.gnome.org/juanje), but I just wanted to try this blog tool made for developers, [Octopress](http://octopress.org/), and see if is easier to share code and ideas.

Actually, some times I just need a place to save my gist with some comments or exaplanation. Other I just want to express some crazy technical ideas, so I think [Github](http://github.com) is a good place for this sort of things :-P

I warning you that I'll probably talk a lot about **Ruby**, [Chef](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef), [DevOps](http://www.jedi.be/blog/2010/02/12/what-is-this-devops-thing-anyway/), [BDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development), [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/) and more similar stuff that I'm crazy about right now :-)

See you soon and Happy Hacking!
