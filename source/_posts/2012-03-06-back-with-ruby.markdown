Long time ago (thanks to a [good friend](http://hcoder.org/)) **I felt in love with Ruby** (_I think it was around 2001_), but I didn't get much into it until years later (2005) when I did some stuff at work.
All these years I've been thinking about come back to learn Ruby and write some code, but you know... time, work...

Now I'm free and have some free time for me to learn all the thing I want, so I'll do so :-)

After (buy and) read some books from [The Pragmatic Bookself](http://pragprog.com/) I decided to give a try to the famous [Programming Ruby](http://pragprog.com/book/ruby3/programming-ruby-1-9). I checked the new version and I realised the book was really improved from the previous ones. _Ruby 1.9_ and really better explanations about the differents subjects.

Even at the first chapters when they explain very basic thinks that I already knew, I learn a lot of new things with each page. It really worths to read it :-)

I will write here some notes about things I learn (or re-learn) with this and other books. I hope be useful for somebody. Anyway, it will be for me :-P

Happy reading and happy hacking ;-)
