    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Long time ago (thanks to a <a href="http://hcoder.org/">good friend</a>) <strong>I felt in love with Ruby</strong> (<em>I think it was around 2001</em>), but I didn't get much into it until years later (2005) when I did some stuff at work.
All these years I've been thinking about come back to learn Ruby and write some code, but you know... time, work...</p>

<p>Now I'm free and have some free time for me to learn all the thing I want, so I'll do so :-)</p>

<p>After (buy and) read some books from <a href="http://pragprog.com/">The Pragmatic Bookself</a> I decided to give a try to the famous <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/ruby3/programming-ruby-1-9">Programming Ruby</a>. I checked the new version and I realised the book was really improved from the previous ones. <em>Ruby 1.9</em> and really better explanations about the differents subjects.</p>

<p>Even at the first chapters when they explain very basic thinks that I already knew, I learn a lot of new things with each page. It really worths to read it :-)</p>

<p>I will write here some notes about things I learn (or re-learn) with this and other books. I hope be useful for somebody. Anyway, it will be for me :-P</p>

<p>Happy reading and happy hacking ;-)</p>
