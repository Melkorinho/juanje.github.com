    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Long time ago (thanks to a <a href="http://hcoder.org/">good friend</a>) <strong>I felt in love with Ruby</strong> (<em>I think it was around 2001</em>), but I didn&#8217;t get much into it until years later (2005) when I did some stuff at work.
All these years I&#8217;ve been thinking about come back to learn Ruby and write some code, but you know&#8230; time, work&#8230;</p>

<p>Now I&#8217;m free and have some free time for me to learn all the thing I want, so I&#8217;ll do so :-)</p>

<p>After (buy and) read some books from <a href="http://pragprog.com/">The Pragmatic Bookself</a> I decided to give a try to the famous <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/ruby3/programming-ruby-1-9">Programming Ruby</a>. I checked the new version and I realised the book was really improved from the previous ones. <em>Ruby 1.9</em> and really better explanations about the differents subjects.</p>

<p>Even at the first chapters when they explain very basic thinks that I already knew, I learn a lot of new things with each page. It really worths to read it :-)</p>

<p>I will write here some notes about things I learn (or re-learn) with this and other books. I hope be useful for somebody. Anyway, it will be for me :-P</p>

<p>Happy reading and happy hacking ;-)</p>

<p>Hi :-)</p>

<p>This is <em>Yet Another Dev Blog</em>. I got already <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/juanje">one for GNOME and Distros&#8217; stuff</a>, but I just wanted to try this blog tool made for developers, <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>, and see if is easier to share code and ideas.</p>

<p>Actually, some times I just need a place to save my gist with some comments or exaplanation. Other I just want to express some crazy technical ideas, so I think <a href="http://github.com">Github</a> is a good place for this sort of things :-P</p>

<p>I warning you that I&#8217;ll probably talk a lot about <strong>Ruby</strong>, <a href="http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef">Chef</a>, <a href="http://www.jedi.be/blog/2010/02/12/what-is-this-devops-thing-anyway/">DevOps</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development">BDD</a>, <a href="http://vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> and more similar stuff that I&#8217;m crazy about right now :-)</p>

<p>See you soon and Happy Hacking!</p>
